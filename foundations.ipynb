    "- A neural net is basically a bunch of matrix multiplications with nonlinearities in between.\n",

    "- Properly initializing a neural net is crucial to get training started. Kaiming initialization should be used when we have ReLU nonlinearities.\n",
    "- The backward pass is the chain rule applied multiple times, computing the gradients from the output of our model and going back, one layer at a time.\n",
    "- When subclassing `nn.Module` (if not using fastai's `Module`) we have to call the superclass `__init__` method in our `__init__` method and we have to define a `forward` function that takes an input and returns the desired result."
