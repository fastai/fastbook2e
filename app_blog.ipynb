But all the approaches I’ve seen to using GitHub Pages have required knowledge of the command line and arcane tools that only software developers are likely to be familiar with. For instance, GitHub's [own documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) on setting up a blog includes a long list of instructions that involve installing the Ruby programming language, using the `git` command-line tool, copying over version numbers, and more—17 steps in total!\n",

You will be up and running with your new blog within about five minutes. It doesn’t cost anything, and you can easily add your own custom domain to it if you wish to. In this section, we'll explain how to do it, using a template we've created called *fast\\_template*.
