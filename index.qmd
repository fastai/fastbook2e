# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is an early version of the second edition of [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527). Most of it hasn't been updated from the first edition yet -- the content here now is largely just copied from the first edition.

Note that chapters shown in *italics* in the sidebar are only available as a preview of the first few paragraphs. The full content of the first edition is available for free as Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/) with only basic formatting. A nicely typeset version can be purchased [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527).

Here's a list of all the full chapters available here:

- @sec-intro:  Your Deep Learning Journey
- @sec-mnist-basics: Under the Hood: Training a Digit Classifier
- @sec-convolutions: Convolutional Neural Networks
- @sec-resnet: ResNets
- @sec-accel-sgd: The Training Process
- @sec-foundations: A Neural Net from the Foundations
