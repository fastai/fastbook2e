    "One of the most interesting architectures in deep learning is the one that we used for segmentation in @sec-intro. Segmentation is a challenging task, because the output required is really an image, or a pixel grid, containing the predicted label for every pixel. There are other tasks that share a similar basic design, such as increasing the resolution of an image (*super-resolution*), adding color to a black-and-white image (*colorization*), or converting a photo into a synthetic painting (*style transfer*)—these tasks are covered by an [online](https://book.fast.ai/) chapter of this book, so be sure to check it out after you've read this chapter. In each case, we are starting with an image and converting it to some other image of the same dimensions or aspect ratio, but with the pixels altered in some way. We refer to these as *generative vision models*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we do this is to start with the exact same approach to developing a CNN head as we saw in the previous problem. We start with a ResNet, for instance, and cut off the adaptive pooling layer and everything after that. Then we replace those layers with our custom head, which does the generative task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a lot of handwaving in that last sentence! How on earth do we create a CNN head that generates an image? If we start with, say, a 224-pixel input image, then at the end of the ResNet body we will have a 7×7 grid of convolutional activations. How can we convert that into a 224-pixel segmentation mask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, we do this with a neural network! So we need some kind of layer that can increase the grid size in a CNN. One very simple approach to this is to replace every pixel in the 7×7 grid with four pixels in a 2×2 square. Each of those four pixels will have the same value—this is known as *nearest neighbor interpolation*. PyTorch provides a layer that does this for us, so one option is to create a head that contains stride-1 convolutional layers (along with batchnorm and ReLU layers as usual) interspersed with 2×2 nearest neighbor interpolation layers. In fact, you can try this now! See if you can create a custom head designed like this, and try it on the CamVid segmentation task. You should find that you get some reasonable results, although they won't be as good as our @sec-intro results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to replace the nearest neighbor and convolution combination with a *transposed convolution*, otherwise known as a *stride half convolution*. This is identical to a regular convolution, but first zero padding is inserted between all the pixels in the input. This is easiest to see with a picture—@fig-transp-conv shows a diagram from the excellent [convolutional arithmetic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285) we discussed in @sec-convolutions, showing a 3×3 transposed convolution applied to a 3×3 image."

    "\n",
    "Neither of these approaches, however, works really well. The problem is that our 7×7 grid simply doesn't have enough information to create a 224×224-pixel output. It's asking an awful lot of the activations of each of those grid cells to have enough information to fully regenerate every pixel in the output. The solution to this problem is to use *skip connections*, like in a ResNet, but skipping from the activations in the body of the ResNet all the way over to the activations of the transposed convolution on the opposite side of the architecture. This approach, illustrated in @fig-unet, was developed by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in the 2015 paper [\"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).

But the reason that deep learning is not straightforward is because your data, memory, and time are typically limited. If you are running out of memory or time, then the solution is to train a smaller model. If you are not able to train for long enough to overfit, then you are not taking advantage of the capacity of your model.\n",

Reducing the size of your model reduces the ability of your model to learn subtle relationships in your data.\n",

That could involve adding more labels to data that you already have, finding additional tasks that your model could be asked to solve (or, to think of it another way, identifying different kinds of labels that you could model), or creating additional synthetic data by using more or different data augmentation techniques. Thanks to the development of Mixup and similar approaches, effective data augmentation is now available for nearly all kinds of data.\n",

For instance, adding batch normalization may improve generalization.\n",

Generally speaking, adding dropout to the last layer or two will do a good job of regularizing your model. However, as we learned from the story of the development of AWD-LSTM, it is often the case that adding dropout of different types throughout your model can help even more. Generally speaking, a larger model with more regularization is more flexible, and can therefore be more accurate than a smaller model with less regularization.\n",
